Project Title:
E-Shop E-commerce Website (MERN)

📝 Project Description:
This is a full-stack e-commerce web application inspired by the minimalist design and functionality of Allbirds.com. The project was built using the MERN stack — MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js — and includes both frontend and backend functionality.

🌐 Features:
🛍️ Browse Products – Users can view a list of products with images, prices, and categories.

🔍 Product Detail View – Each product has its own dedicated page with more information.

🧾 User Authentication – Users can register and log in using JWT-based authentication.

🛒 Shopping Cart – Authenticated users can add products to a cart and view their selections.

🧑‍💼 Order Placement – Users can place orders by providing a shipping address and payment method.

📜 Order History – Logged-in users can view their past orders.

🔐 Protected Routes – Only authenticated users can access sensitive endpoints (e.g., order placement).

📦 API Integration – The React frontend communicates with the Express backend using axios.

🧰 Tech Stack:
Frontend: React, React Router DOM, Axios, Tailwind

Backend: Node.js, Express.js

Database: MongoDB (via Mongoose)

Authentication: JSON Web Tokens (JWT), bcrypt

API Testing: HTTPie 

Development Tools: VS Code, Nodemon, Git, GitHub

🎯 Goal:
To simulate a professional e-commerce experience that is visually clean, responsive on all devices, and structurally modeled after real-world online stores. The project reinforces skills in RESTful API design, full-stack integration, protected routes, and modern UI development.
